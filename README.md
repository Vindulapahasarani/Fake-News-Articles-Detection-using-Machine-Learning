Fake News Articles Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting fake news articles by analyzing textual data. With the rapid spread of misinformation, it's crucial to have systems that can identify fake news. The project is implemented using Python and Google Colab, leveraging machine learning techniques to classify articles as either "Real" or "Fake."

Features:
Data Collection: The dataset used includes labeled news articles with "fake" or "real" tags. It is preprocessed to clean the text data, including removing stopwords, punctuation, and performing tokenization.
Text Preprocessing: Techniques like word vectorization using TF-IDF and Word2Vec are applied to convert text into numerical features.
Model Training: Machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are trained on the processed data to classify the articles.
Evaluation: The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its performance in identifying fake news.
Google Colab: The entire project is developed in Google Colab, allowing the use of powerful computing resources for training the models efficiently.

Key Libraries Used:
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
TensorFlow/Keras (optional for deep learning approaches)
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)

Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a reliable classifier that can automatically detect whether a news article is fake or real, assisting in combating the spread of misinformation.
